## Overview

`bbssr` is a comprehensive R package designed for **blinded sample size re-estimation (BSSR)** in two-arm clinical trials with binary endpoints. Unlike traditional fixed-sample designs, BSSR allows for adaptive sample size adjustments during the trial while maintaining the statistical integrity and blinding of the study.

### Key Features

- **Blinded Sample Size Re-estimation**: Implement adaptive trial designs that adjust sample sizes based on pooled data without unblinding treatment assignments
- **Multiple Exact Statistical Tests**: Support for five different exact statistical tests optimized for binary endpoints
- **Flexible Design Options**: Choose between restricted, unrestricted, and weighted BSSR approaches
- **Comprehensive Power Analysis**: Calculate exact power for both traditional and BSSR designs
- **High-Performance Computing**: Optimized algorithms deliver significant speed improvements over existing packages
- **Validated Accuracy**: Extensive validation confirms identical results to established packages (`Exact`, `exact2x2`) across multiple scenarios

### Statistical Methods Supported

The package implements five exact statistical tests specifically designed for binary endpoints in clinical trials:

1. **Pearson chi-squared test** (`'Chisq'`) - One-sided exact test
2. **Fisher exact test** (`'Fisher'`) - Classical exact conditional test
3. **Fisher mid-p test** (`'Fisher-midP'`) - Less conservative alternative to Fisher exact
4. **Z-pooled exact unconditional test** (`'Z-pool'`) - Unconditional exact test with pooled variance
5. **Boschloo exact unconditional test** (`'Boschloo'`) - Most powerful unconditional exact test

## Why Use BSSR?

Traditional clinical trials with fixed sample sizes often suffer from:
- **Inefficient resource allocation** when initial assumptions are incorrect
- **Underpowered studies** due to overly optimistic effect size estimates
- **Ethical concerns** about continuing underpowered or overpowered trials

BSSR addresses these issues by:
- **Maintaining statistical validity** through exact methods
- **Preserving blinding** by using only pooled response rates
- **Optimizing sample sizes** based on observed data
- **Improving trial efficiency** while controlling Type I error

## Installation

Install the released version from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("bbssr")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gosukehommaEX/bbssr")
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Power Calculation

```r
library(bbssr)

# Calculate power for a traditional design
power_traditional <- BinaryPower(
  p1 = 0.5,     # Response rate in treatment group
  p2 = 0.2,     # Response rate in control group  
  N1 = 40,      # Sample size in treatment group
  N2 = 40,      # Sample size in control group
  alpha = 0.025, # One-sided significance level
  Test = 'Fisher' # Statistical test
)

print(power_traditional)
```

### Sample Size Calculation

```r
# Calculate required sample size
sample_size <- BinarySampleSize(
  p1 = 0.5,           # Expected response rate in treatment group
  p2 = 0.2,           # Expected response rate in control group
  r = 1,              # Allocation ratio (1:1)
  alpha = 0.025,      # One-sided significance level
  tar.power = 0.8,    # Target power
  Test = 'Boschloo'   # Most powerful exact test
)

print(sample_size)
```

### Blinded Sample Size Re-estimation

```r
library(dplyr)

# BSSR with different design rules
bssr_result <- BinaryPowerBSSR(
  asmd.p1 = 0.45,      # Assumed response rate in treatment group
  asmd.p2 = 0.09,      # Assumed response rate in control group
  p = seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.1), # Range of pooled response rates
  Delta.A = 0.36,      # Assumed treatment effect
  Delta.T = 0.36,      # True treatment effect
  N1 = 24,             # Initial sample size in treatment group
  N2 = 24,             # Initial sample size in control group
  omega = 0.5,         # Fraction for interim analysis
  r = 1,               # Allocation ratio
  alpha = 0.025,       # Significance level
  tar.power = 0.8,     # Target power
  Test = 'Z-pool',     # Statistical test
  restricted = FALSE,   # Unrestricted design
  weighted = FALSE     # Non-weighted approach
)

head(bssr_result)
```

## Advanced Example: Comparing BSSR Designs

```r
library(bbssr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Compare different BSSR approaches
power_comparison <- tibble(
  Rule = factor(
    c('Restricted', 'Unrestricted', 'Weighted'), 
    levels = c('Restricted', 'Unrestricted', 'Weighted')
  ),
  restricted = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
  weighted = c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
) %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  reframe(r = c(1, 2), N1 = c(24, 36), N2 = c(24, 18)) %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  reframe(
    BinaryPowerBSSR(
      asmd.p1 = 0.45, asmd.p2 = 0.09, p = seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.01),
      Delta.A = 0.36, Delta.T = 0.36, N1, N2, omega = 0.5, r, 
      alpha = 0.025, tar.power = 0.8, Test = 'Z-pool', 
      restricted, weighted
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    Rule = factor(Rule, levels = c('Restricted', 'Unrestricted', 'Weighted')),
    Allocation = paste0('Allocation ratio = ', r, ':1')
  )

# Visualize the results
ggplot(power_comparison, aes(x = p, y = power.BSSR, color = Rule)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
  facet_wrap(~Allocation) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.8, color = 'gray', linetype = 'dashed') +
  labs(
    x = "Pooled Response Rate (θ)",
    y = "Power",
    title = "Power Comparison: BSSR Design Rules",
    subtitle = "Horizontal line shows target power = 0.8"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The plot above demonstrates how different BSSR design rules perform across various pooled response rates. Key observations:
  
  - **Weighted Design**: Shows the most robust performance with consistent power across different pooled response rates
- **Unrestricted Design**: Provides good flexibility while maintaining target power
- **Restricted Design**: More conservative approach that ensures final sample size ≥ initial sample size
- **Allocation Ratios**: Different allocation ratios (1:1 vs 2:1) show distinct power patterns

## Key Functions

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `BinaryPower()` | Calculate power for traditional fixed-sample designs |
| `BinarySampleSize()` | Calculate required sample size for given power |
| `BinaryPowerBSSR()` | Calculate power for BSSR designs |
| `BinaryRR()` | Compute rejection regions for exact tests |

## Design Options for BSSR

### Restricted Design (`restricted = TRUE`)
- Conservative approach
- Final sample size ≥ initially planned sample size
- Maintains original study timeline

### Unrestricted Design (`restricted = FALSE`)  
- Flexible approach
- Allows both increases and decreases in sample size
- Optimizes efficiency based on observed data

### Weighted Design (`weighted = TRUE`)
- Advanced approach
- Uses weighted averaging across interim scenarios
- Provides robust performance across different pooled response rates

## Statistical Validity

All methods in `bbssr` maintain exact Type I error control at the specified α level. The package implements exact statistical tests rather than asymptotic approximations, ensuring validity even for small sample sizes commonly encountered in clinical trials.
